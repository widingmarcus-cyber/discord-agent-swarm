# Long-term Memory

This is where agents store curated, long-term knowledge.
Daily files capture raw events. This file captures distilled wisdom.

## How to use
- Agents review daily files during quiet periods
- Important insights get promoted here
- Outdated information gets removed
- Think of this as the agent's "long-term memory"
